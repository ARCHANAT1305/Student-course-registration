# EXP - 5 STUDENT ENROLLMENT SYSTEM
## AIM:
To draw a UML diagram for STUDENT ENROLLMENT SYSTEM
## SRS (Procedure):
STEP 1: Gather information about the system, its components, and user interactions.  
STEP 2: Decide which diagram best suits your needs (e.g., Use Case, Class, Sequence, etc.).  
STEP 3: List the key entities, classes, objects, and relationships that need to be represented.  
STEP 4: Identify how the elements interact (e.g., associations, dependencies, inheritance).
STEP 5: Select a UML diagramming tool  and start drawing the diagram.   
STEP 6: Position elements (classes, actors, etc.) on the diagram and draw relationships between them.
